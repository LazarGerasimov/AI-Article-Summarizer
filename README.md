Backend is using the Article Extractor API from RapidAPI - https://rapidapi.com/restyler/api/article-extractor-and-summarizer

The application supports history of previous searches as well as fully integrated copy button for better UX to save the user marking lengthy URLs. 

A button on the top right was added that redirects to my github repo for this project. 

Enjoy using the tool!
